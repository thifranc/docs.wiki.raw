# What is Liquid Investigations ?

Liquid Investigations is a network infrastructure that makes it easy for anyone to collaboratively research and co-create knowledge. Robust and built from the margins of Europe by journalists and technologists. 

# Story 

Today Liquid is a solid digital infrastructure where you can co-create knowledge by searching and exchanging information between and beyond your institutional boundaries. Using Liquid you can build your research network of choice, adding suitable workflows and governance rules. New collaborative applications will keep popping-up and Liquid is designed to integrate the best of them.  

Liquid is an alternative place to migrate away from global centralized platforms offered by large for-profit or non-profit global players. 

# Motivation 

Digital tools to support team work in the realm of knowledge co-creation, be it for journalism or for any other type of collaborative research, are global centralized platforms, reinforcing world inequalities and leading a wave of global digital colonization. They become governance tools and contributors who depend on them end up being surveilled, controlled and misused by the owners of such digital infrastructures. Currently there is no one-stop shop, free and open source, to offer such an infrastructure.  

# Current Features 

Liquid is a self-hosted knowledge production platform, allowing users full control over their data. 

Currently, the Liquid bundle let’s you index, OCR & search, tagg, build wikis, chat, share files, collaborate on pads and annotations in a self-hosted environment behind a 2FA layer. It’s scalable from cheap hardware up to enterprise grade environments.

Liquid integrates already established and easy to use apps, allowing for a seamless, collaborative workflow. Currently packaged applications:
* Index and Search: Hoover, multi-faceted search technology, creating a bridge between all the other apps
* Wiki: Dokuwiki
* Chat: Rocket.chat 
* Share files: Nextcloud
* Pads: CodiMD
* Annotations: Hypothes.is 

# Future

The current teamwork infrastructures are displacing all individuals towards U.S. owned global clouds (Microsoft Teams, Atlassian, Zoom). Built-in limitations of the centralized platforms will hit more walls than the Orwellian surveillance or censorship capabilities (), the cascading global outages of [Google](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/14/google-suffers-worldwide-outage-with-gmail-youtube-and-other-services-down), [Slack](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213105/slack-outage-down-2021-server-error), [Twitter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/16/twitter-outage-social-media-platform-goes-down-across-the-world), [GitHub](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-hit-with-multiple-back-to-back-outages/ ), [FaceBook](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-outages-idUSKBN2BB232) or the [data-centers on fire ](https://www.dna.fr/faits-divers-justice/2021/03/10/strasbourg-important-incendie-dans-une-entreprise-situee-sur-un-site-seveso-au-port-du-rhin).  

The roll out of changes in legislation will hit the platform-based economy: GDPR and enforced transportability of data; monetized contributors treated as [employees](https://www.ft.com/content/73be294b-a43d-4387-aced-7b5cb0d91007) and monetization by force of free knowledge exchanges [reigned in](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-56163550).  

Independence from global digital colonization will become a non-negotiable value. In the realm of knowledge co-creation, groups of people will want to start self determining their digital lives and renegotiate the basis of collaborations across institutions. The first step is to have no dependency on the digital infrastructures they use, their workflows, their ownership and their business models and be the only ones who can decide how to govern their groups and interactions and how and if to monetize such interactions. 

Liquid is here to foster independent knowledge co-creation, be it for journalism, activism, academia or in-between and beyond.

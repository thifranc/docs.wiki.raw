Liquid Investigations is enabling journalists working across the world to collaborate securely, effectively and at low cost as well as independent of centralised infrastructures and platforms.  

Liquid Investigations is a free, open-source software that’s self-hosted and bundles together index, OCR & search, wikis, chat and file-sync systems and annotations in a secure self-hosted environment. It’s scalable from cheap hardware up to enterprise grade environments.

With Liquid Investigations we are lowering the barriers for journalistic collaborations, empowering journalists towards:
*  censorship resistance by way of networking;
*  digital security during the research process (for protecting info-exchange, whistleblowers and source docs);
*  anonymity towards infrastructure admins and owners by way of not retaining search logs;
*  focusing on holding power transparent and accountable.

With the full bundle in production we allow for distributed, non-hierarchical data analysis, as well as sharing, information exchange and annotation for journalists in networks.

## Project History & Funding

The core code started to be developed for the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (RCIJ) at the end of 2015 as an index & search tool for a small network of Romanian journalists to be able to search documents (RCIJ is one of the oldest investigative journalism non-profits in Europe, established in 2001). 

It got adopted and further developed by the European Investigative Collaborations network (EIC) during 2016, while EIC was  starting to process a growing collection of leaked material (Football Leaks). 

During 2017 RCIJ won a Google DNI grant (https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/dnifund/insights/liquid-investigations-helping-journalists-collaborate-safely-scale/) to develop the bundle. 

After the grant was over, since 2018, the bundle was further developed with financial support from EIC.network, which is a non-profit network by agreement where each media organisation who's a member is putting human and financial resources together to research stories and maintain or develop tools for investigative journalists (which are published under free and open source).

*Reminder*: Manage Liquid user creation and invitations from the "Liquid Investigations" home page `[admin]` interface, not from the Hoover Admin interface - both have the same theme, and one might confuse them.

### Add User

Click on +Add, on the right side of Users; 
Or click on Users and use the ADD USER + button on the right;

### Set Username and Initial Password

Add username and password (I use firstname.lastname convention); **don’t use “-”**.
If the username is taken, you'll get an error (add surename or change order).

**Note**: When 2FA is being used, this initial password cannot be used to enter the account - use some random text twice, create an invitation link afterwards. The user will not need this initial password to use the link.

### User details

You've been redirected to edit the user's information;
On First name we add the entire name (both first and last name);
On Last name we add the name of the media organization;
On Email address the user's email;
Everything else should be left to default;
Click Save, on the bottom right.

## Board user (and 2FA Re-invite process)

The user should have the Prerequisites (without admin privilege).

Go to Users in the Liquid Investigations home page `[admin]` interface (as shown in first screenshot above), type in the username and click Search.

Click the checkbox to select the user.
On Action dropdown menu, select Create invitations and click Go.

Send the generated url to the user via encrypted email only.

The link will be valid for 30 minutes and a single use, repeat this process if it expires.

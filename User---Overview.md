Welcome to Liquid Investigations. 

## Intro

The main goal of this software is to facilitate secure online collaborations for any interest group and professional community that handle information with different degrees of sensitivity.

Liquid Investigations is EIC's in-house free, open-source  tools bundle  (index, OCR & search, wiki, chat, file-sync, pad and annotations in a self-hosted environment behind a 2FA layer), promoting secure information-exchange and collaborative knowledge production.

## What is the regular workflow between all these apps?

Once you find yourself on the Liquid Investigations homepage, the best way to start navigating the system is to start with the chat app ([Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User---Rocket.Chat)). This way you will immediately connect with your fellow collaborators, who may also lend a hand and tell you a bit about how the system works for them.

Click the **RocketChat** link on the Liquid homepage, (ignore the request to input a user and password), and follow the blue line telling you to `CLICK HERE TO GET IN!` and connect to the other users.

If you want to share documentation, please return to the Liquid Homepage and click on ([NextCloud](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User---Nextcloud)), our file sharing app. Besides uploading your source documents, the NextCloud app will allow you to also view the contacts for all the users in the system????
All the documents you upload in NextCloud are indexed, and OCRed (if needed), and made searchable via [Hoover](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User---Hoover), our performant search app, under the 'Uploads' collection. 

Use the **Hoover** search app for all other searches and ask your coordinator for permissions if you feel you deserve to see more collections. 

Activate your annotation powers and leave a mark on documents and findings with [Hypothesis](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User---Hypothesis). 

If you need to take notes for yourself or for a team, use our real time note pad ([CodiMD](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User---CodiMD)).

Detailed instructions on how to search, share, engage with others and keep an overview on where is what are in our [Wiki](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User---DokuWiki) system. Thatâ€™s where our knowledge base is growing (yeah, like a wilde forest). 

Otherwise navigate in-between the apps clicking the liquid logo or the text `-> Liquid at work`.

Here you have an overview of our [User Guide](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User-Guide).

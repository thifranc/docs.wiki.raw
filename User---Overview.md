Welcome to Liquid Investigations. 

The best way to enter the system is to start with the chat (Rocket.Chat). Follow the link, ignore the request to input a user and password, and just follow the blue line and `CLICK HERE TO GET IN!` and connect to the other users.

Getting back to this homepage you will be able to post your source documents in a file sharing app (Nextcloud). That’s the same place where you will see all contacts for the users of this system. 

All documents you upload are indexed, and if needed OCRd, and made searchable in Hoover (under the Uploads collection). 

Use Hoover for all other searches and ask your coordinator for permissions if you feel you deserve to see more collections. Activate your annotation powers and leave a mark on documents and findings with Hypothesis. If you need to take notes for yourself or for a team, use a pad (CodiMD).

Detailed instructions on how to search, share, engage with others and keep an overview on where is what are in our Wiki system. That’s where our knowledge base is growing (yeah, like a wilde forest). 

Otherwise navigate in-between the apps clicking the liquid logo.

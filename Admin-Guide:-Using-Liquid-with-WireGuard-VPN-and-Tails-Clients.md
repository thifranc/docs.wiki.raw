Liquid can be used in an isolated environment accessible using a WireGuard VPN only. Moreover, a slightly more paranoid setup is using Tails accessing this isolated service.

Consider the generic instruction to [use Liquid with VPN](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/Admin-Guide:-Using-Liquid-on-VPN), first.

# Setting up the server-side WireGuard VPN

# Adding clients

# Provision Tails to be a client

# Additional configs for local DNS and Certificates

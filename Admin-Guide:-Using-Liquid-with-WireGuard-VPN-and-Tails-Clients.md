# Liquid using WireGuard and Tails

### Work in progress
***

Liquid can be used in an isolated environment accessible using a WireGuard VPN only. Moreover, a slightly more paranoid setup is using Tails accessing this isolated service.

Consider the generic instruction to [use Liquid with VPN](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/Admin-Guide:-Using-Liquid-on-VPN), first.

## Setting up the server-side WireGuard VPN

Based on top of the [WireGuard Quick Start](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/) you may want to use the [WireGuard installer](https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install) provided by [angristan at GitHub](https://github.com/angristan).

## Adding clients

## Provision Tails to be a client

## Additional configs for local DNS and Certificates

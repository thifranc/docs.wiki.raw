# take research or meeting notes, plan, brainstorm

While you investigate a lead in a large collection of documents and have 100 more tabs opened, it’s hard to keep track. 

You can open your investigation pad by using the CodiMD app in the bundle (https://codimd.liquiddemo.org/) Sign up (the system will remember your Liquid login information) and begin to write up new notes. 

When you’re done, decide if you want to keep the note for yourself (private) or if you want to make it editable by the group (upper right corner). 

Sharing the url to an editable pad makes the pad the most collaborative place on Liquid bundle, since content can be added by all users in real time (say during a meeting for all users to add meeting notes, or during a coordination meeting to organise tasks and assignments).

# Browser configuration with caching

### install tor browser portable edition, rename folder to "LIQUID", put on desktop

###  hack up the tor browser settings -- https://github.com/CRJI/EIC/issues/626 for performance issues related to Caching

### advise users to keep separate tor browser install just for accessing liquid (since it's insecure for anything else)*

# Browser configuration with caching

### Install Tor browser portable edition

* Go to https://www.torproject.org/download/, select the operating system of your choice and plug in your removable media
* Your portable Tor browser will be downloaded on to your USB key or SD card
* Rename folder to "LIQUID", put on desktop


###  hack up the tor browser settings -- https://github.com/CRJI/EIC/issues/626 for performance issues related to Caching

### advise users to keep separate tor browser install just for accessing liquid (since it's insecure for anything else)*

First make sure your system meets the [[Hardware requirements]].

1. Install `cluster` following the [instructions in the Readme](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/cluster#quick-start). We recommend you check out the repo as `/opt/cluster`, the rest of the wiki assumes this path.
2. Install `node` following the [instructions in the Readme](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/node#installation). We recommend you check out the repo as `/opt/node`, the rest of the wiki assumes this path.

Go to [[User Guide]] for instructions on creating users and granting access. For development tips, go to [[Hacking]].

Follow the [[Maintenance]] page on how to keep the system up to date.

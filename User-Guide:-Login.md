_First time Users_

Prerequisites for logging into Liquid Investigations

Have an Authenticator enabled: 
* Google Authenticator - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator
* Duo Mobile- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile&hl=en&gl=US
* Have  an encrypted communication channel (e.g. Signal desktop)

A new user will get their credentials (username and a one-time onboarding URL) via an encrypted channel (e.g. Signal desktop). You will maintain the created username but may change your password. You will be asked to scan a QR code with your 2FA app:

To finalize the account creation process you will then be prompted to also enter your 6 digit authentication code.
**Please make sure to activate your account in the next 12 hours!** Otherwise the link will expire.

_Login_

Login by typing your username, password and TOTP token (if two-factor authentication is enabled). After a predefined time (by default 12 hours, configurable, can be disabled) the system will automatically log you out.

# growing a knowledge base 

Information is shared in different ways in this bundle - but if you want your information to have a longer life and contribute to stories, then you should create wiki pages in the DokuWiki (https://dokuwiki.liquiddemo.org/doku.php). 

With each project a knowledge base is growing. 

We organise wiki pages under directories (namespaces) named after the journalistic projects (e.g. Malta Files, Football Leaks etc). All of these have sub-directories named after the production stage (either info or confrontation or replies or drafts). 

In order to start a directory you need to use the **Crate a New Page:** button in Root and add the name of your directory and related page (use the name of your investigative project, e.g. Watergate:overview) 

For instance a bunch of annotations that signal interesting findings will be soon put together in a wiki page called Football Leaks:information:doyen_corporate_structure (like here https://dokuwiki.liquiddemo.org/doku.php?id=football_leaks:information:doyen_corporate_structure); before publication, a page containing confrontation questions will be added, called Football Leaks:confrontation:doyen (https://dokuwiki.liquiddemo.org/doku.php?id=football_leaks:confrontation:doyen) and before publication, during the stage where journalists share their drafts, a draft will be shared called Football Leaks:draft:The Dirty Tricks of Doyen Sports (https://dokuwiki.liquiddemo.org/doku.php?id=football_leaks:draft:the_dirty_tricks_of_doyen_sports). That will eventually land in the public domain (https://theblacksea.eu/stories/football-leaks/football-leaks-the-dirty-tricks-of-doyen-sports/).

## Write a Wiki

Search to see if there is other information available on the Wikis. Use the search box on the upper right corner. 

If there is, make a judgement as to whether your information needs a new standalone Wiki page or can be integrated into the existing Wiki page you found.

### How to construct a Wiki page

Use the **Crate a New Page:** button. Choose an existing directory or sub-directory to be the parent of your page. Don’t create orphans ! 

Once you clicked Add page, you need to also add content to the page and Save it. 

Check the Sitemap (just below the search box on the upper right corner) and see if the page is under the right directory. If not, mouse over the symbols on the sidebar on the right of your page and choose Rename Page and simply change the names of the directories and sub-directories in the url (e.g. instead of  Football Leaks:confrontation:The Dirty Tricks of Doyen Sports you can have  Football Leaks:draft:The Dirty Tricks of Doyen Sports) moving the page from the confrontation subdirectory to the draft subdirectory. 

### Wiki pages labels and names

You should name your wiki exactly what it is: a wedding list, a deal, a company structure, a bio for a person etc. That should be reflected in the wiki title. For inspiration go read some wikipedia articles.

Confrontation pages should be created after the drafts are done. The confrontation pages should list ALL people and institutions that need to be confronted with written questions before the story is ready. In confrontation pages, each EIC journo should have the time to add his/her questions.

Replies pages are mirrors of confrontation pages, only they include the exact copy/paste of the questions send, in the original language they were sent, as well as the replies, with the time stamp, email used etc

## How to edit a Wiki page

For the syntax used to obtain headers, bold, colours etc, please read the syntax page (https://dokuwiki.liquiddemo.org/doku.php?id=wiki:syntax)

Write at the top of the Wiki who is the owner of that Wiki and their contact details with the name [OWNER:]. Underneath this, write the names of all the people who have contributed to writing this Wiki with their contact details, with the name [CONTRIBUTOR:]

Clearly label the provenance of any information in a URL link at the beginning of every relevant paragraph. Using ((text)) you put that text in a footnote.  

Clearly label whether information is from a source with [SOURCE:] at the beginning of every relevant paragraph.

Clearly label whether information is speculation [SPECULATION:] at the beginning of every relevant paragraph. 

If you want to write a comment on the Wiki, or dispute a piece of information, or believe something is unclear, use annotations - select that sentence and annotate under the specific group or in public (e.g this does not make senseB)
 
The end resulting information wiki page should be a clear sourced information page that can be fact checked by anybody who reads it for the first time.

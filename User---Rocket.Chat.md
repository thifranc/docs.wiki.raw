Well, first come to the place where communication happens. Use Rocket.chat. Your username is already there, created automatically when you login to Liquid. 

Start by going here https://rocketchat.liquiddemo.org/directory. You will see all public available channels. If you want to join any of them, click on the channel and, well, join!

In that same place you can also see a list with all users. If you want to engage in one-to-one chatter, please click the user and start exchanging information. If you want to have extra-security, go to the chat upper right corner, and click the sandwich button for settings (More) and click OTR (a key symbol). 

After the other user is confirming the OTR session, all your messages will be encrypted end-to-end. Be careful, after the session expires, you won’t find any archive of these messages exchanged under OTR.  

Feel like sharing a document by a quick drag&drop ? Tough luck, this option is disabled. We use Nextcloud (link to Nextcloud explainer) to share documents, because they can stay in the archive longer, they are indexed and OCRd (by language - link to OCR language folder) and they are searchable. 

Chat rooms are usually dedicated to topics to investigate, or to logistical exchanges (like maintenance, or sharing urls post-publication). 

Inside a chat room with many people talking about many things at once, you may choose to engage in a Thread (a short exchange on a specific topic) or to start a Discussion, which works like a talk inside a talk (and has it’s own url to share, like this https://rocketchat.liquiddemo.org/channel/general?msg=EMRzxhqfYiKrLWMA3 ). Discussions can be dedicated to meetings, and for sharing meeting urls and notes, so they all stay in one place. They are listed on your left bar, same as the chat rooms and your private groups and communications. 

Private Groups are locked chat rooms. Only invited people can get in. They are not visible to the rest of the participants. 

For each chat room, private group or discussion, you have on the upper right corner a way to see all members of that space, you can search for the archive (be aware, we prune these rooms now and then, so don’t use the chat rooms as archives) and you can see info related to the rooms. 

A guide to RocketChat is available here: https://rocket.chat/docs/user-guides/ . Some stuff that you will see on the guide won't work. Assume is by design (or make a big issue here)

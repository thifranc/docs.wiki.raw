This is the communications platform.

A guide to RocketChat is available here:

You might recognise this because it is a rip-off of slack

Your username is created automatically and is the same as your username on the login page

There are two sections here - ‘channels’, where users can communicate in a group, and ‘users’, where you can communicate directly with an individual

i) To see the existing channels, these appear on both the leftthand column and in the ‘directory’, which is the globe icon on the upper toolbar of the leftthand column.

In the directory are a list of public channels and a list of users. 

NB: This is not ‘public’ in the sense that anyone can access it, only ‘public’ to all the users of the system.

ii) To access the general chat, go to the ‘G’ icon, and press on #general

iii) To access public channels, click on these in the directory

iv) To communicate with other users, click on the ‘users’ section in the directory

v) To access a private channel, you need an invitation from the owner of the channel. 

vi) To create a private channel, go to the pencil icon in the upper toolbar on the left hand column, click on #channel, and this gives you options on what you can create, and who you can invite to the channel

This is EIC network's collaborative knowledge base, that grows stronger with every EIC project.  A detailed guide to Wiki.js is available here: https://docs.requarks.io/. Some of the functionalities from the guide might not be implemented. Assume is by design or let our dev people know.

Below some of the key functionalities debunked:

### Create Page

Wiki.js doesn't have a folder structure in the traditional sense. You never need to create folders in order to create new pages. Instead, you create pages directly at the path of your choice. That said, you can have both folders with nested pages in them or just standalone pages.

On the homepage, please check out the side bar on the left-hand, to view what folders and/or pages have been already created.

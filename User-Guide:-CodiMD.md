The CodiMD pad helps you take research or meeting notes, plan, brainstorm in real time with others. While you investigate a lead in a large collection of documents and have 100 more tabs opened, it’s hard to keep track.

Just click sign in via Liquid (the system will remember your Liquid login information) and hit the blue ‘New Note’ button to create a new pad.
The history tab centralizes all your current pads. You can search pads by keywords or tags and can reorder the pads based on title or time created.

When you’re done, decide if you want to keep the note for yourself (private) or if you want to make it editable by the group (upper right corner).

Sharing the url to an editable pad makes the pad the most collaborative place onLiquid Investigations, since content can be added by all users in real time (say during a meeting for all users to add meeting notes, or during a coordination meeting to organize tasks and assignments).

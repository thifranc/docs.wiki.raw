# Development

The different components require different setups for working on them.
Please take note of our [[Hardware requirements]] before attempting to run the services on your machine.


### Working on the infrastructure

No special instructions are needed here; simply clone the `node` repository and patch it to your needs, without chaning anything inside the service containers themselves.


### Working on backend services

Go to https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/node/blob/master/docs/Development.md for details on mounting each container's code to your local machine.



### Working on the Hoover UI

Go to the UI repository https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/hoover-ui and follow the instructions there to use an already existing backend when doing UI development.

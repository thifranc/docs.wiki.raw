# sharing (documents and stuff)

One way to share documents is for your system administrator to index and make searchable a collection of documents (link https://github.com/hoover/snoop)  

Another way to share documents is to drag and drop documents to Nextcloud (https://nextcloud.liquiddemo.org/). You can use the search box (upper right corner) to find a folder where you want to bring your documents, or you can create/upload your own folder (see picture). 

Each folder has an action menu: details is for a shortcut url to share with others; move is to relocate the document within the system; you can rename, download or delete the folder (in case of deleting, thing twice, because the folder will not be available anymore for the entire group of people working on your Liquid bundle). 

Since you are on Nextcloud, you may want to add your contacts, or see the contacts of the other participants in your Liquid bundle (see picture). 

A guide to Nextcloud is available here:Â https://docs.nextcloud.com/desktop/2.3/. Most stuff that you will see on the guide won't work. Assume is by design (or make a big issue here).

# searchin' for informan 

All documents uploaded in Nextcloud will be available for search in Hoover. They will be indexed after upload (and OCR’d) under a collection called Uploads. 

In Hoover, searches begin by selecting the collections to search and by type and click a keyword or a search query (you can see search operators here https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/hoover-search/wiki/Guide-to-search-terms.  Batch searches are possible ( a batch search button is available under the right end of the search bar). 

First filters available before the search are the number of results to be displayed and the order of the search results (relevant, old, new). 

After the results are displayed, more filters are available: by date range; by filetype; by language; by email domain (since this tool is under heavy use for leaked data-sets, and since emails are a big chunk of leaks, this is a filter to filter out specific email domain that bring too much noise in the list of results, like newsletters or spam emails). 

A column of results is displayed in the middle of the screen, and by clicking each result, a preview of the document is made available on the right column. 

You can navigate down (shortcut key is J) and up (shortcut key is K) or select a preview to open in a new tab (shortcut key is O). When you find a document that’s interesting and you want to share it with others, hit the key C and the unique identifier of the document (MD5) and the path to the document will be copied to clipboard. You only need to hit CTRL V to paste them in the chat, into a wiki page or into a pad for research notes (e.g. c1639872eca52928046c6fcb50b76491 is the MD5 and 
/data/Norica NICOLAI - 96825/96825_DFI_rev0_RO.pdf is the path to this document https://hoover.liquiddemo.org/doc/avere-europarl/06537836113a2f84d160eb7c21ad69d75579ba0385b5f9dc463a723732d419bf )

Once you open a document in a new tab, you can you can navigate up and down in the indexed folders (left column, hit Up like in the picture). And you can download the document or print it (it won’t print the MD5 and the path, so from the point of view of metadata, you don’t need to store it in a secure place. But even print outs can be tricky https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170607-why-printers-add-secret-tracking-dots).

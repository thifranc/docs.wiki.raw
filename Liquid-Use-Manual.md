# Liquid Demo Draft Directory


This is a guide to how to navigate Liquid Investigations, a combined secure communication channel and a repository of documents and information for journalists.

## 1. Login Page


If you want to access liquid, please type in your username and password, and press ‘login’


## 2. Liquid Investigations


This is the main private members’ portal, which has four sections

i) If you want to find documents in indexed collections, you can click on ‘Hoover’

ii) If you are looking for, or want to write, drafts or stories, or to add findings, go to ‘DokuWiki’  

iii) If you want to communicate with other members of the network, you can go to ‘RocketChat’

iv) If you want to share files, documents, videos, photos and other related material, go to ‘Nextcloud’



## 3.Hoover

This is where you can find documents in indexed collections

(i) If you are looking to search all documents by keyword, type in the keyword in the ‘search’ field.

The findings will appear as a list in the center of the screen.

To see a specific document, click on the file.

The file will appear on the righthand column.

To change this to fullscreen, click on the arrow at the top of the column, which opens the document in a new window.

(ii) If you are looking to narrow down your search, these are steps you need to take:

To search by collection, on the lefthand column, click on the arrow in ‘collections
Then unselect by clicking ‘all’
Click on the collection you want to search
Continue the search as before

(iii) You can also search by date range, file type, language and email domain*** [EXAMPLES NEEDED HERE]

(iv) To exit Hoover, but remain on Liquid, click on ‘Liquid Investigations’ at the top of the page.



## 4. Dokuwiki


This opens on the start page 

[it depends what will appear here, whether it is a directory, or a black start document]
[If it is a directory, this should be a tree-like structure which leads you to existing projects]

We should detail here:

i) How to make links

ii) How to start a new project, and how to name it

iii) How to add a document to an existing project, and how to name it

iv) Outline the difference between ‘findings’ and ‘info’


For the specifics on how to write wikis - refer to videos and manuals [NEED LINKS HERE]

To begin a Wiki, click on the pencil icon on the righthand side of the page

To save a page, click on the ‘Save’ icon at the bottom of the document.

If you are confused on how it functions, go to playground [LINK HERE]

To return to homepage click on ‘Liquid Investigations’



## 5. Rocket Chat

This is the communications platform.

A guide to RocketChat is available here:
https://rocket.chat/docs/user-guides/

You might recognise this because it is a rip-off of slack

Your username is created automatically and is the same as your username on the login page

There are two sections here - ‘channels’, where users can communicate in a group, and ‘users’, where you can communicate directly with an individual

i) To see the existing channels, these appear on both the leftthand column and in the ‘directory’, which is the globe icon on the upper toolbar of the leftthand column.

In the directory are a list of public channels and a list of users. 

NB: This is not ‘public’ in the sense that anyone can access it, only ‘public’ to all the users of the system.

ii) To access the general chat, go to the ‘G’ icon, and press on #general

iii) To access public channels, click on these in the directory

iv) To communicate with other users, click on the ‘users’ section in the directory

v) To access a private channel, you need an invitation from the owner of the channel. 

vi) To create a private channel, go to the pencil icon in the upper toolbar on the left hand column, click on #channel, and this gives you options on what you can create, and who you can invite to the channel

Logout process: [POSSIBLY LOOK INTO]


## 6. Nextcloud


This is a channel open to all users, where you can upload documents, pictures, videos and files.

i) To search for documents and folders, click on the magnifying glass on the righthand side of the top blue toolbar, and add a keyword

ii) To add a folder, click on the ‘+’ icon and rename

iii) To add files, click on the ‘+’ icon inside the folder and add ‘upload file’

## Overview 
This month, we kept our priority of stabilizing and improving collection indexing process. The initial approach was to do that by changing Snoops' task management system. After intensive research, we could not find a third party solution that could magically fix all our problems, so we eventually focused on improving the internal task dispatching, currently used. Another feature to be deployed is automated importing/exporting a collection, from one machine to another. This comes in useful for the new Coconut collection, which was indexed on secondary machines like Rb and Xe, but needs to be moved on Neon, to be accessible for journalists.

February is also the last month (sadly! oh, so sadly!) we have Alex on the project ðŸ˜¢

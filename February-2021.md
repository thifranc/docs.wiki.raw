## Overview

During this month, the team started to focus on two major objectives: pinning down a roadmap for our product and a framework to organize our work and development process more efficiently.

Once a feature set was defined and structured by Gabi in a rank-able format, a survey was sent to our users to gather feedback directly from them and prioritize the roadmap according to their needs.

In terms of development process, we started to work in 2 week Sprints, adding Agile ceremonies such as Planning, Retro and a Release gateway.

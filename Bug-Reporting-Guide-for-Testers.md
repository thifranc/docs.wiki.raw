# How To Report A Bug


When reporting bugs, the key is to give enough information so that the developer can make the website fail in front of them in the same way. If they cannot do that, then they will need to keep asking you for more information until they can make it fail.

## In order to do this, you should provide at least the following information: 


### The priority of the issue 


High priority incidents as "Major" Priority - website doesn't load at all.
Medium priority incidents as "Normal" Priority - I see pages, but functionality is sketchy. 
Low priority incidents as "Low" Priority - everything works, however this button is offset.

### The browser and operating system you are using 

Go to http://www.thismachine.info/ and copy/paste the information shown.

### Website information 

  * Which website you are using (full url) 

  * Whether you are logged in to it

  * The username of the account you have logged in with.

## Precise steps to reproduce the bug.

Here you need to detail exactly what you did to get to the bug - this the most important part of any bug report. Be as precise as you can.

  * Imprecise: "Go to my account".
  * Precise: "When logged in, click on the "My account" link on http://www.mywebsite.com/".

After your steps, precisely describe the observed result and the expected result. Clearly separate facts (observations) from speculations.

  * Imprecise: "It doesn't work"
  * Precise: "Instead of showing my account, it shows the message 'Your browser does not support cookies (error -91)'."

## Reference to Business Rules which document how this should work (where applicable)

It may be that what you're seeing is not a bug, but a feature you are not familiar with. 

Please search to find where it is documented, and compare your experiences with what should happen. Include a link or reference to the documentation in your bug reports.

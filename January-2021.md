## Overview

The year starts in the same pace as the last one ended: working on the tagging system on both BE and UI and supporting production at the same time, with user impacting issues. In parallel, we are starting to think ahead: what do we want to achieve, mid/long term, how can we organize better in order to get there and which features would have more impact and worth adding to our bundle.
The month will wrap up with an interactive meeting / workshop with the journalists using our system day by day.

## Development


### Get started with development ##
There is a [Reading List](https://hackmd.io/upSx7g7qSYSjE0poRtprkQ?view) we made for the 2020 summer internship. It references all the main components in the system.

### Setup development environment ##
The different components require different setups for working on them.
Please take note of our [[Hardware requirements]] before attempting to run the services on your machine. If you need instructions to set up for development see [[Contributing:DevFirstSteps]].

### Working on the infrastructure
No special instructions are needed here; simply clone the `node` repository and patch it to your needs, without chaning anything inside the service containers themselves.

### Working on backend services
Go to https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/node/blob/master/docs/Development.md for details on mounting each container's code to your local machine.

### Working on the Hoover UI
Go to the UI repository https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/hoover-ui and follow the instructions there to use an already existing backend when doing UI development.
